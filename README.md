The two jupyter notebooks contains the code of first part of the Credit risk Model.
First part was about to develop a classification model to predict the probability of default of a borrower.
The steps include:
- Data Extraction
- Data Preprocessing: EDA, treating null values, add new features, finding significant features by Weight of Evidence and plotting
